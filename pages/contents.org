** Programming WebAssembly with Rust
*** Introduction
**** with webassembly there is a symbiotic relationship between the compiled WebAssembly binary(called a module) and the host responsible for interpreting it
***** this relationship is at the heart of everything that you can do with this new technology and understanding where the boundaries are between module and host is key to being able to build effective WebAssembly applications.
**** WebAssembly can be view at two different levels - the raw, foundational level and at the higher level of other programming languages using WebAssembly as a target
**** you could write loosely coupled business logic that flows between servers, services, clients and browsers
